# ETH token study
A study on Ethereum Smart Contracts and Solidity programming.

## Description
In this project, for education purposes I created a very simplified (but still functional) version of a token upon Ethereum network using Solidity language, deployed to the Ropsten testnet using Remix and performed mint and transfers of the token between wallets sucessfully.
